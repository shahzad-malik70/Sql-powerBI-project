Data Cleaning and Visualization Project

Project Overview

This project focuses on cleaning raw data using SQL and performing advanced data visualization in Power BI. The data was first cleaned and transformed using SQL queries, after which additional columns were created. A Power BI desktop file was developed to visualize the insights through various charts and reports.


Contents

project_.pbix: Power BI file containing the visualizations and dashboards created based on the cleaned data. This file showcases:

Data analysis and new calculated columns.

Visual reports on customer behavior and trends.

PROJECT_SCRIPT.sql: SQL script used to clean and prepare the data. This includes:

Data transformation steps.

SQL queries used to filter, aggregate, and clean the dataset.


Tools Used

SQL: For data cleaning and transformation.

Power BI: For visualizing the data and building dashboards.

Key Insights

Insights into customer behavior, trends, and performance metrics.

Creation of new calculated fields in Power BI for better analysis.

Visual representation of the data through charts and graphs.

Instructions

SQL Cleaning: The PROJECT_SCRIPT.sql file contains the SQL queries that cleaned and transformed the data. You can run this in your SQL environment to replicate the data cleaning process.

Power BI Visualizations: The project_.pbix file contains the Power BI dashboard. Open it in Power BI Desktop to explore the insights and reports.

How to Use

Data Cleaning: Begin by using the SQL script to clean your raw data.
